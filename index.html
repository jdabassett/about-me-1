        Hi, my name is Marco Villafana (he/him). I am an army veteran and live in Washington state. I was an information technology specialist. Where I did desktop support and network support.  Since then, I earned a Bachelor of Science with a major in computer science from Central Washington University. I am still undecided on what to specialize in and web design wasn't covered very much in my degree, so I'm interested in finding out if this is something I want to pursue.
